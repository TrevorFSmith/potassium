# RETIRED REPO, DO NOT USE

Hi there!

This repository was the original home of PotassiumES, back when it was a tiny blob of code for just the flat web. You shouldn't use this code, but I've left it here for historical purposes.

Eventually, PotassiumES will have a nice home at PotassiumES.org, which doesn't yet exist at the time that this page was written. In the meantime, go check out the new [PotassiumES GitHub org](https://github.com/PotassiumES), especially the [projects section](https://github.com/orgs/PotassiumES/projects) where you can see how we're creating a framework for the wider web.

Stay wide,
